  <h1>Features of Jaiffa</h1>


NOTE: This material is obsolete.  For now, see the tutorial.
  
  <h2>Basics</h2>
  
  <p>Jaiffa tries to be the simplest interactive fiction system that
  can possibly fly, while not suffering from artificial limitations.
  As such, it sticks to the basics:</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>two-word parser;</li>
   <li>"flat" containment;</li>
   <li>before/after;</li>
   <li>darkness;</li>
   <li>daemons.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The world model is only made up of:</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>rooms;</li>
   <li>exits;</li>
   <li>doors (with locks and keys);</li>
   <li>actors;</li>
   <li>things.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>It also provides the game author with a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent interface</a>,
  making development as easy as it can be in a language like Javascript.</p>
  
  <h2>The parser</h2>
  
  <p>While the parser is a simple two-word affair, I didn't want it to
  be frustrating. I wanted sane error messages, and to allow commands
  such as "pick up remote" or "talk to man". I also made it easy to
  create synonyms for both verbs and objects, and it's possible to
  have local commands (of arbitrary length) that override anything
  else -- with the downside that the player must know the exact
  spelling.</p>
  
  <h2>Missing features</h2>
  
  <p>Jaiffa notably lack support for undo and save/restore. Because
  daemons and verb handlers are ordinary Javascript functions which
  can be replaced on the fly, serializing the game state -- and most
  importantly putting it back the way it was -- can range from
  difficult to impossible depending on the browser.</p>
  
  <p>Jaiffa should learn which words represent exit names, so it can
  answer "you can't go that way", the way Alan 3 does. For that matter,
  a predefined compass wouldn't hurt either.</p>
  
  <p>Embedding a game needs to be easier. Much easier.</p>
