  <h1>Overview of Javascript Interactive Fiction/Adventure system</h1>
  
  <h2>What it is</h2>
  
  <p>Jaiffa (Javascript Interactive Fiction/Adventures) is a toy
  library for the creation of text adventures that can be embedded in
  a Web page. It was created as a programming exercise and idea
  testbed. Jaiffa is small, fast, and easy to use, study or modify.</p>
  
  <p>Jaiffa provides a <abbr>DSL</abbr>
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language">Domain Specific Language</a>)
  for the creation of text adventures, but the user interface needs
  to be implemented separately. The demo adventure comes with
  example code.</p>
  
  <h2>What it is not</h2>
  
  <p>Jaiffa is not meant for real-world usage. If you want to write
  serious interactive fiction, I urge you to consider one of the
  <a href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Category:Authoring_system">mainstream authoring systems</a>.
  Jaiffa is kept deliberately simplistic; any game made with it would
  be far from meeting the expectations of a modern player. Also, due
  to the syntax of Javascript, writing long messages is difficult.</p>
  
  <h2>What makes it special</h2>
  
  <p>Jaiffa borrows what I consider to be some good simplifying
  ideas from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU*">MU*s</a>.</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Doors can be locked, but not opened or closed. (Why? I'm yet to
   play a text adventure where it actually matters. So I did away with
   that.)</li>
   <li>The containment model is simplistic: only rooms and actors can
   contain other objects. (And scope is pretty much always the same.)</li>
   <li>There is no concept of a compass. Exits are arbitrary. (That
   makes implementation easier, besides, not everyone likes the
   compass metaphor.)</li>
   <li>Rooms are lit by default. (The opposite makes sense from a
   simulation perspective, but not from a game design perspective.)</li>
   <li>Objects and exits in a room are explicitly listed. No more
   guessing what is and isn't there, or relevant for that matter.
   (OK, that's probably going to be controversial. Heh, I wish.)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Some additions of my own:</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Objects are nailed down by default. That prevents a lot of
   bugs right from the start.</li>
   <li>The player's location is considered to be in scope. That allows
   commands such as 'clean kitchen' to be easily implemented.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Compatibility</h2>
  
  <p>Jaiffa works in Firefox 3.5, Opera 10, Arora 0.10 (Webkit-based),
  and partially in Konqueror 4 and Nokia Browser.</p>
  
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  
  <p>Right now the parser is restricted to two-word commands. It's
  plenty enough to implement a complete, if primitive, adventure.
  But I'd like a future version to be smarter.</p>
  
  <p>No save, load or undo yet. To restart, just reload the Web page.</p>
  
  <p>No light sources either; for now, just flip the dark flag on
  rooms manually.</p>
  
  <p>The library messages should be gathered in one place for easy
   translation.</p>
