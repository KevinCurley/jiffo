Jiffo
======

Jiffo ("Javascript Interactive Fiction Framework
that's Open Source Software") is a framework for
creating parser-based interactive fiction (IF) games/stories
that is open source software (OSS) and built on Javascript.

It's designed to be easy to get started with and use.
It is released under the MIT license, so there are basically no
restrictions on reuse or modification.
Since it's in Javascript you can easily and directly use all the
capabilities of Javascript, as well as the wealth of libraries,
documentation, and so on for Javascript.

Jiffo is derived from Jaiffa
(the Javascript Interactive Fiction/Adventure system) by
Felix Ple&#537;oianu.
However, Jaiffa emphasizes being small, simple, and easy to understand
its internals; Jiffo's goal is to instead provide more functionality
(even if that complicates things).
We thank the Jaiffa developers!

For more information, see the tutorial in file ./tutorial.md
(the tutorial explains more about it and how to use it).
You can also see the sample game ./catch-that-cat.html included in this package.
