Jiffo
======

Jiffo ("Javascript Interactive Fiction Framework
that's Open Source Software") is a framework for
creating parser-based interactive fiction (IF) games/stories
that is open source software (OSS) and built on Javascript.

It's designed to be easy to get started with and use.
It is released under the MIT license, so there are basically no
restrictions on reuse or modification.
Since it's in Javascript you can easily and directly use all of
Javascript's capabilities, libraries, and so on.

For more information, see the tutorial in file [tutorial.md](./tutorial.md)
(the tutorial explains more about it and how to use it).
You can also see the sample game [catch that cat](./catch-that-cat.html)
included in this package.
